# learning_d3
Examples of work I did throughout the book, http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html

For each chapter in the book I create, what I called a takeaway, 
an html file that I write and build up while reading through the given chapter. 
This allowed me to really visualize the d3 code I was learning and plug and play with different options as I learned.
I definitely got a lot more out of this interactive version of learning a language (especially a web based one).
The way everything remains sequential in the process of learning it becomes a lot like math and you keep seeing
the things you learned in the previous chapter and because you're writing out everything each time you really get
that practice and repetition that engrains this type of knowledge in your head.
